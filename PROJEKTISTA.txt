Hi !

My name is Jere Borgelin and I'm going to give you more indepth look at the layout of the entire page.
As you may have seen already, we have re-created the whole layout. 
In the old layout it wasn't as easy to navigate your way around the page.
Now in this layout it's quite the opposite. All the navigation is now located on both sides of the page.
So as you are holding the tablet horizontally, you can use just your thumbs to navigate, without moving your hands.

The navigation is split in to two groups. There is the primary group here at the left side, witch contains these sort of "first tier pages".
Then there is this secondary group of links on the right hand side, witch contains tools specific to the page, that you chose from the left
Then let's say you want to create a new test group, so you would go from left to right. First you tap / click from the left "Test group"-link and 
then you got this second group of links here
